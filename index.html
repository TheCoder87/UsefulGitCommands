<h3>15) How to override one branch with Other branch</h3>
	<p>You should be able to use the "ours" merge strategy to overwrite master with seotweaks like this:<br/>

	git checkout seotweaks<br/>
	git merge -s ours master<br/>
	git checkout master<br/>
	git merge seotweaks<br/>

<h3>17) How to revert a specific file to specif commits state</h3>
	<p>Assuming the hash of the commit you want is abcde:<br/>
	git checkout abcde file/to/restore<br/>
	Note if you want to revert changes made to the files in commit abcde you have to pass the commit right before abcde.<br/>
	You can use abcde~1 for this.<br/>

	As a side note, I've always been uncomfortable with this command because it's used for both ordinary things (changing between branches) and<br/>
	unusual destructive things (discarding changes in the working directory).</p>

<h3>18) How to see the all properties of git config settings</h3>
	<p>$ git config --list</p>
	
<h3>19)	What is 'cherry-Pick' mean in git:-</h3>

	<p>Cherry picking in git means to choose a commit from one branch and apply it onto another.<br/>
	
	This is in contrast with other ways such as merge and rebase which normally applies many commits onto a another branch.	<br/>
	Make sure you are on the branch you want apply the commit to.<br/>
	
	git checkout master<br/>
	Execute the following:<br/>
	
	git cherry-pick <commit-hash></p>
